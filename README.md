# beUI

My personal UI component library â€” built with **React**, **TypeScript**, and **Tailwind CSS v4**.
This isnâ€™t meant to compete with MUI/Chakra/etc. â€” itâ€™s my own **playground + toolbox** for projects.

---

## ðŸŒ± Why?

* I hate restyling buttons and inputs from scratch every time.
* I want my projects to share the same vibe / design language.
* Itâ€™s also a great excuse to learn about design systems, bundling, docs, and all the painful fun that comes with UI libraries.

---

## ðŸ›  Stack

* **React + TS** â†’ components with strong types
* **Tailwind v4** â†’ config-less theming with `@theme`
* **tsup** â†’ build system (ESM + CJS, tree-shakable)
* **(maybe later)** â†’ Storybook/Playground for previews

---

## ðŸ“¦ Usage

This library is for me, so Iâ€™ll just:

* Symlink it into projects with `npm link`, or
* Copy/paste components when I feel lazy.

If I *do* publish it to npm one day, the install will be:

```bash
npm install beui
```

## ðŸ§± Components (WIP)

* [x] Button
* [ ] Input
* [ ] Card
* [ ] Modal / Dialog

---

## ðŸš§ Development

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/beui.git
cd beui
npm install
npm run dev
```

Build:

```bash
npm run build
```

## ðŸ“Œ Notes

* beUI = for my eyes first.
* Design system is still evolving.
* Expect messy commits while I experiment.
